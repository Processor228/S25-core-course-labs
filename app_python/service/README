## Service deployment

### Local installation and testing

Optional: you may wanna set up venv
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Beforehand, install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r reqiurements.txt
```

And starting the service is as easy as running one command (make sure project root is `service` folder)!
```
python3 -m uvicorn main:app
```
